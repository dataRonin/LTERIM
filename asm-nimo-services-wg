Topic : Interacting with Scientist, Strawman, Market Place Skillset and miscellaneous things from the NIMO scope

  Interactions with Scientists: 
  
     IMs serve the science, and the scientist.  We receive and execute the requests.
     We use common Language - No lingo, no jargon. 
     Surveys of past/present interactions between our scientists and our IMs : What worked, what did not work.
     Pet project dangers - prioritization bias.
     
  Interactions with Communications Office - A point of contact per project to tend Comms working group needs.
     
  Interactions at LTER Sites - IM as point of contact - NIMO as shopping place to escalate medium to large requests.
     
  Low effort (3hrs load or smaller?), locally addresseable request are dealt by local IM or appropiate remote IM
  Perceived medium to high effort task are elevated for proper evaluation, prioritization and assignment. 
  No request is unimportant, every user story request is evaluated, catalogued and ranked in the bucket.
  Data on requests resolve ratios is used to inform NSF about needs and demands.
  Data on IM resolution and effort is used to credit authors appropriately.
            
  Non-LTER requests (user stories) are considered and throttled according to needs and strategic interest.
     
  Mechanics:  User story/request submission: 
    to a Bucket List site
    communicated to the im-rep (then moved to bucket)
    through committees (moved to bucket)
         
  Backlogged requests: Communication back to user owner
         
  Accepted requests: Design of plan, assignment of project responsible, and user owner.
