WG5: 3D Scientific Visualization (Terrain Mapping)
=====

Template for Scribes
----

#### SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION FORMAT: 30 min - 4:50 – 5:20.  

Members of each group will self-introduce and share their responses to the questionnaire.  Each group is led by a person who did a mini-presentation and appoints a scribe and reporter (please give or email scribe/reporter notes to the organizers after the report back).


* *Notes of Note: (don’t fit into the categories below, but Ned wanted to have on record)*

* FOSS4g conference upcoming to look into for open platforms
* The idea of a multi-layer archive:
  * code
  * executable code
  * [older] operating systems to support archived code
  * [older] hardware that supports those OS

#### Role of information managers as living memory of data tools

* Scribe Instructions:
  * The scribe in each group will compile 3 lists (use list_template):
  * List of the software used by the small group participants
  * JavaScript
  * R
  * Python
  * some more advanced members are also using resources in list below (#2):

#### List of tools and resources that participants know about (websites, etc.)
  * R
  * JavaScript
  * In Python, Map plot lib linked to JavaScript d- link is called MPLD3, by mike bostock
  * Bl.ocks
  * Tool tips that can drag around
  * Cross Filter (unconfirmed) - can use to translate large and older files into code - data processing step
  * Bostock-github see all his stuff
  * iPython notebook
  * JMP - as data analysis product
  * Google earth, Google earth engine - host Lidar
  * Html5/css3/javascript
  * Esri -ArcGIS
  * Osgo
  * Qgis- PostGIS (better for the open source web and cloud support)
  * Geo-Django- Python based and o-auth supported web framework
  * Role of information managers as living memory of data tools
  * Importing Lidar into arc
  * Need to have archives for code not just data- GITHUB!
  * Docker virtualizes code, OS - shipping platform - docker hub for sharing
  * Babel for translating ancient systems

#### List of data sources used (NASA, DEMs, etc.)
  * specific data sources beyond LTER not discussed
  * Questions for discussion (used to organize the group report):
    * What are the best aspects of the visualizations shown by presenters and by Ned in his keynote talk this morning?
    * Changes over time - Looking at land use change over time, and timing of peak runoff for instance
    * Communication between scientists and non-scientists
    * Would be huge in pin-pointing thresholds
    * aiding in the cognitive process of visualization in idling relationships
    * helping scientists do exploratory analysis of data, since humans can see trends visually much more easily than through number runs
    * working through graphics and visualizations departments at universities as a launching point

#### What are the limitations?
  * coding literacy
  * lack of existing template so that researchers at least know
  * what sorts of data and script to be providing/seeking out
  * how to compile data sets from days past that are either not digitized, or are in different formats that may not lend themselves easily to visualization software tools
  * price, depending on preferred program
  * disconnect between animation role in industry vs, where science is - hard to get grad students up to speed, and data managers overwhelmed

#### How could those visualizations be improved, i.e., with new features?
  * democratizing visualization tools and resources, although that has arguably already been done through R and Python
  * archiving code, executable code
  * creating a template of sorts that code illiterate users can plug data into to generate basic visualizations - a visualization “widget” of sorts
  * have a workshop/tutorial for scientists on nuts and bolts of getting started - perhaps at LTER ASM meetings - or try to get NSF to fund separate workshop

>>>Software (other than that used by presenters) that might do the same thing: (unsure which of the resources mentioned in the lists at the top have this functionality)

#### What kind of data do you use and is it appropriate for visualization?  

* Data mentioned by breakout group:
* Getting data visualized for large datasets (from data managers)
* Science communication
* Difference in variation in wood chemistry
* Phytoplankton - may not work for his project, but very interested in science communication
* Combining technology and code with biosciences
* Using visualization for theory animations
* Information management
* how veg communities are changing in comparison to climate data
* Lidar scans of streams, wants something better than arc scene

#### How did you get started with 3D visualization?

>>>Mentioned by attendees:
playing around with available softwares - R, Python, JavaScript, as well as earlier softwares that have since evolved
Lter communications office, Sgi machines, main platforms used for modeli and animation in early days


#### Can you think of OTHER applications for visualization?

#### How might you use 3D visualization in your work?
* Getting data visualized for large datasets (from data managers)
* Science communication - education and outreach tool
* Difference in variation in wood chemistry
* Combining technology and code with biosciences
* Using visualization for theory animations
* Information management
 how veg communities are changing in comparison to climate data
* Lidar scans of streams, wants something better than arc scene

* Report back and discussion – 30 min.  Each group presents highlights of their discussion.

Please send lists to Stafford@umn.edu, or give hardcopy to her at the end of the session!
